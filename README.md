# SimpleWeatherWebsite
I am a new(self taught) phyton programmer. I made a simple weather wbsite after learning the basics. SimpleWeatherApp is a basic web application built using Python and the Flask framework. It allows users to input a city name and retrieve the current weather and temperature information for that city from the OpenWeatherMap API. The HTML part doesnt work though. Why?
